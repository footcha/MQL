## Summary
MQL (Mapping Query Language) is a domain specific language (DSL) for analysts who design data warehouses. Its primary purpose is to define data transformations from stage to target layers in the warehouse. The language is based of ANSI SQL. It contains language constructs that simplify definitions of common transformation patterns.
